# Welcome! 
This is the Django Framework for my site.

# Download 
To set up and load, install Django to your pc or mac using pip. This might work : </br> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/install/ </br>
Now, clone the git onto your pc.

# Installation 
cd into the folder directory and run the following commands: </br>
   python3 manage.py makemigrations </br>
   python3 manage.py migrate </br>
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser </br>
   python3 manage.py runserver </br>
   (By creating an admin, you can access the admin page through this link : http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) </br>
   (make sure the local link is http://127.0.0.1:8000/) </br>
   To open the first page, go to the /first page : http://127.0.0.1:8000/first (index.html unfortunately wasn't working) </br>
   Other steps are self explanatory </br>
