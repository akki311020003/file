 # Conclusion/Hurdles # </br>
   This project was destined to be multiple times better than this but unfotunately, I had my coaching classes and I had gone on a vacation for some time owing to which I only got 4 days or so to complete the project. I had also included a login page but couldn't provide the link due to last minute horrors. I was also going to make react componentsfor the project but time was a hurdle again. It took me two days to make the backend and I started frontend on the third day and as evident, the first page looks well done, but to my horrors, the backend was no longer working. I had to make it all again and time was less. I still focussed on the Authentication aspects and it can be seen working on the last page where I display the username. I also created a login form but couldn't integrate it due to less time remaining. Also through this project, I have learnt how to use the django famework to create a usable backend for a website. I used to work with PHP earlier but found Django 100 times more useful and easier to use.   </br>
   I also do app development and Game development. I along with some of my friends designed the www.teanewsnetwork.com 2 years ago, but it had to be brought down due to low traffic and less revenue. We are right now working on a newer website called www.critist.com which is scheduled to be complete by August 2019. I hope you are hyped up for it ecause it is gonna be amazing. Be there!  </br>
   Please judge my project accordingly. </br>
